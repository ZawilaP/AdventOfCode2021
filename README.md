# AdventOfCode2021

This repository contains my solutions of 2021s Advent of Code exercises.

My main goal during this year exercise solving was to use more advanced scala features. I wanted to put into use some of the Functional paradigms I've learned while reading https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala, and to apply some of the knowledge I've gained at work.

Most of the exercises went through few iterations of cleaning up and optimization. If after solving the exercise myself I found inspiring solutions of others, I tried to apply their logic to my solutions, to gain new insights on Scala.

If you have any questions about any solutions I'm more than eager to help out :).
